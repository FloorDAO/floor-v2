# NFTXSellNFTForETH
[Git Source](https://github.com/FloorDAO/floor-v2/blob/537a38ba21fa97b6f7763cc3c1b0ee2a21e56857/src/contracts/actions/nftx/SellNFTForETH.sol)

**Inherits:**
[IAction](/src/interfaces/actions/Action.sol/contract.IAction.md)

This action allows us to batch sell ERC721 NFT tokens from the {Treasury}
into a specific NFTX vault.
This uses the NFTX Marketplace Zap to facilitate the trade, allowing us to
specify a minimum amount of ETH to receive in return.


## State Variables
### marketplaceZap
The NFTX Marketplace Zap contract


```solidity
INFTXMarketplaceZap public immutable marketplaceZap;
```


### WETH
Mainnet WETH contract


```solidity
address public immutable WETH = 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2;
```


### treasury
The {Treasury} contract that will fund the NFT tokens and will be
the recipient of the swapped WETH.


```solidity
address public immutable treasury;
```


## Functions
### constructor

We assign any variable contract addresses in our constructor, allowing us
to have multiple deployed actions if any parameters change.


```solidity
constructor(address _marketplaceZap, address _treasury);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_marketplaceZap`|`address`|Address of the NFTX Marketplace Zap|
|`_treasury`|`address`|Address of the Floor {Treasury} contract|


### execute

Sells our specified `tokenIds` from the NFTX vault collection to gain instant
ETH liquidity. If the transaction doesn't provide the specified required `minEthOut`
then the transaction will be reverted by NFTX.


```solidity
function execute(bytes calldata _request) public returns (uint);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_request`|`bytes`|Packed bytes that will map to our `ActionRequest` struct|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`uint256`|uint The amount of ETH generated by the execution|


### onERC721Received

Allows the contract to receive ERC721 tokens from our {Treasury}.


```solidity
function onERC721Received(address, address, uint, bytes memory) public virtual returns (bytes4);
```

## Structs
### ActionRequest
Store our required information to action a swap.


```solidity
struct ActionRequest {
    address asset;
    uint vaultId;
    uint[] tokenIds;
    uint minEthOut;
    address[] path;
}
```
