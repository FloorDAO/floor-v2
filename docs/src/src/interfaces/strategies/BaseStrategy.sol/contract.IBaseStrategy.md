# IBaseStrategy
[Git Source](https://github.com/FloorDAO/floor-v2/blob/c8169a0594ad07a37d169672a50f4155c41be809/src/interfaces/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol)

Strategies will hold the logic for interacting with external platforms to stake
and harvest reward yield. Each vault will require its own strategy implementation
to allow for different immutable variables to be defined during construct.
This will follow a similar approach to how NFTX offer their eligibility module
logic, with a lot of the power coming from inheritence.
When constructed, we want to give the {Treasury} a max uint approval of the yield
and underlying tokens.


## Functions
### initialize

Allows the vault to be initialised.


```solidity
function initialize(bytes32 name, uint strategyId, bytes calldata initData) external;
```

### name

Name of the strategy.


```solidity
function name() external view returns (bytes32);
```

### strategyId

The numerical ID of the vault that acts as an index for the {StrategyFactory}.


```solidity
function strategyId() external view returns (uint);
```

### lifetimeRewards

Total rewards generated by the strategy in all time. This is pure bragging rights.


```solidity
function lifetimeRewards(address token) external returns (uint amount_);
```

### lastEpochRewards

The amount of rewards claimed in the last claim call.


```solidity
function lastEpochRewards(address token) external returns (uint amount_);
```

### available

Gets rewards that are available to harvest.


```solidity
function available() external returns (address[] memory, uint[] memory);
```

### harvest

Extracts all rewards from third party and moves it to a recipient. This should
only be called by a specific action.

*This _should_ always be imposed to be the {Treasury} by the {StrategyFactory}.*


```solidity
function harvest(address) external;
```

### validTokens

Returns an array of tokens that the strategy supports.


```solidity
function validTokens() external view returns (address[] memory);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`address[]`|address[] The address of valid tokens|


### pause

Pauses deposits from being made into the vault. This should only be called by
a guardian or governor.


```solidity
function pause(bool _p) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_p`|`bool`|Boolean value for if the vault should be paused|


### snapshot

..


```solidity
function snapshot() external returns (address[] memory, uint[] memory);
```

## Events
### Deposit
*When strategy receives a deposit*


```solidity
event Deposit(address token, uint amount, address caller);
```

### Harvest
*When strategy is harvested*


```solidity
event Harvest(address token, uint amount);
```

### Withdraw
*When a staked user exits their position*


```solidity
event Withdraw(address token, uint amount, address caller);
```
